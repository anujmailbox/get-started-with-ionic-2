# [Get Started With Ionic 2][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


The Ionic framework is one of the most popular projects on GitHub. By letting web developers use their existing skillsets to make apps for mobile devices, Ionic has enabled a whole generation of apps. One of the reasons for Ionic's success is that it builds on the popular Angular web framework. That means a lot of changes to Ionic with the new version of Angular.

With the upcoming release of Angular 2 the Ionic team has rewritten their framework from the ground up. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you all about the Ionic framework and will show you how to build a mobile app from the ground up. Along the way, you'll learn about the Ionic component library, about programming statically-typed JavaScript with TypeScript, and about integrating an Ionic 2 app with a rich media API.
